Last weekend, I discovered the pixel art. 
The goal is to reproduce a pixelated drawing.
**Anyone can do this** without any drawing skills because you just have to reproduce the pixels one by one (on a squared paper).
Kids and big kids can quickly become addicted to this.

## Example

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.pinimg.com/564x/91/af/46/91af46f50866bc7b95e72c4b3891dc52--man--iron-man.jpg")
```

For this pixelated ironman, you need only 3 colors (black, yellow and red).
At the beginning I thought this would be really easy and quick.
It took me approximately 15 minutes to reproduce this.
Children could take more than 1 hour to reproduce this, so it's nice if you want to keep them busy.

## Make your own pixel art models

On the internet, there are lots of models. 
There are also tutos on how to make models with Photoshop.
Yet, I wanted to make an R package for making pixel art models, based on any pictures.
The pipeline I came up with is the following:

- read an image with package **magick**
- downsize this image for processing
- use K-means to project colors in a small set of colors
- downsize the image and project colors
- plot the pixels and add lines to separate them

I think there may be a lot to improve but from what I currently know about images, it's the best I could come up with as a first shot.

I made a package called **pixelart**, with an associated Shiny App.

```r
# Installation
devtools::install_github("privefl/pixelart")

# Run Shiny App
pixelart::run_app()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privefl/pixelart/master/webshot.png")
```
